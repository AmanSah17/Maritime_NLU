# 🍪 Session Persistence Fix - Browser Refresh Issue

**Problem:** Credentials were lost upon browser refresh  
**Solution:** Implemented browser cookie-based session persistence  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

Streamlit's `st.session_state` is **only valid during a single session**. When the browser refreshes:
1. Streamlit reruns the entire script
2. Session state is reset to initial values
3. User loses authentication

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Installed `streamlit-cookies-controller`**
```bash
pip install streamlit-cookies-controller
```

This library allows us to:
- Read/write cookies from the browser
- Persist data across page refreshes
- Maintain session across browser restarts

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### File 1: `auth_manager.py`

**Added Cookie Support:**

```python
from streamlit_cookies_controller import CookieController

# New methods added:
- save_to_cookies()      # Save auth token to browser cookies
- restore_from_cookies() # Restore auth from cookies on page load
- clear_cookies()        # Clear cookies on logout
```

**Key Features:**
- 7-day cookie expiration
- Automatic token validation
- Secure cookie settings (SameSite=Lax)
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens

### File 2: `pages/auth.py`

**Updated Login Flow:**

```python
# On page load: Try to restore from cookies
if not st.session_state.get("authenticated"):
    AuthManager.restore_from_cookies()

# On successful login: Save to cookies
AuthManager.save_to_cookies()

# On logout: Clear cookies
AuthManager.clear_cookies()
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Login Flow (with persistence)

```
1. User enters credentials
   ↓
2. Credentials validated against database
   ↓
3. JWT token created
   ↓
4. Token saved to session_state
   ↓
5. Token saved to browser cookies ← NEW!
   ↓
6. User logged in
```

### Browser Refresh Flow (with persistence)

```
1. User refreshes page (F5)
   ↓
2. Streamlit reruns script
   ↓
3. auth.py loads
   ↓
4. restore_from_cookies() called ← NEW!
   ↓
5. Token retrieved from browser cookies
   ↓
6. Token validated (still valid?)
   ↓
7. User automatically logged in ← NEW!
```

### Logout Flow (with cleanup)

```
1. User clicks logout
   ↓
2. Session state cleared
   ↓
3. Cookies cleared ← NEW!
   ↓
4. User logged out
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Login and Refresh
```
1. Login with credentials
2. Press F5 (refresh)
3. ✅ Should stay logged in
```

### Test 2: Close and Reopen Browser
```
1. Login with credentials
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser
4. Go to dashboard URL
5. ✅ Should stay logged in (within 7 days)
```

### Test 3: Logout
```
1. Login with credentials
2. Click logout
3. Refresh page
4. ✅ Should be logged out
```

### Test 4: Token Expiration
```
1. Login with credentials
2. Wait 24 hours (JWT expires)
3. Refresh page
4. ✅ Should be logged out (token expired)
5. ✅ Cookies should be cleared
```

## 📝 Code Examples

### Saving to Cookies (on login)
```python
# After successful authentication
st.session_state.auth_token = token
st.session_state.authenticated = True
st.session_state.username = email

# Save to cookies for persistence
AuthManager.save_to_cookies()
```

### Restoring from Cookies (on page load)
```python
# At the start of auth.py
AuthManager.init_session_state()

# Try to restore from cookies
if not st.session_state.get("authenticated"):
    AuthManager.restore_from_cookies()
```

### Clearing Cookies (on logout)
```python
# When user clicks logout
AuthManager.logout()  # Clears session AND cookies
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before Fix
```
1. User logs in ✅
2. User refreshes page ❌ LOGGED OUT
3. User must login again ❌
```

### After Fix
```
1. User logs in ✅
2. User refreshes page ✅ STILL LOGGED IN
3. User can continue working ✅
4. Session persists for 7 days ✅
```

## 🔄 Browser Compatibility

✅ Chrome/Chromium  
✅ Firefox  
✅ Safari  
✅ Edge  
✅ Opera  

All modern browsers support cookies.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Cookie Expiration
Edit `auth_manager.py`:
```python
# Change from 7 days to 30 days
expires = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=30)
max_age=30 * 86400  # 30 days in seconds
```

### Change Cookie Security
Edit `auth_manager.py`:
```python
# For production with HTTPS
controller.set(
    "auth_token",
    st.session_state.auth_token,
    secure=True,  # Only send over HTTPS
    same_site="strict"  # Stricter CSRF protection
)
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies

```
streamlit>=0.63
streamlit-cookies-controller>=0.0.4
```

Both are installed and ready to use.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Cookies work in development mode.

### Production
```bash
# Use HTTPS for secure cookies
gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app --ssl-keyfile=key.pem --ssl-certfile=cert.pem
```

---

## ✅ Verification

Run the system verification:
```bash
python verify_system.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Admin user exists
✅ Admin authentication works
✅ JWT token generation works
✅ Database status: 6 users
✅ Email validation working
✅ Password validation working

🚀 System Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION
```

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### "Still logging out on refresh"
- Clear browser cookies manually
- Restart Streamlit
- Check browser console for errors

### "Cookies not persisting"
- Check if cookies are enabled in browser
- Verify `streamlit-cookies-controller` is installed
- Check browser privacy settings

### "Token validation failing"
- Token may have expired (24 hours)
- Try logging in again
- Check system time is correct
