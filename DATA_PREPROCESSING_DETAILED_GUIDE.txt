================================================================================

Document Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-10-29
Purpose: Comprehensive guide to preprocessing steps and rationale

================================================================================
1. DATA ACQUISITION & INITIAL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

1.1 DATA SOURCE
- AIS (Automatic Identification System) data from maritime monitoring systems
- Industry Standard: IMO (International Maritime Organization) regulated
- Frequency: 1 report per 10-30 seconds for commercial vessels
- Coverage: Global maritime traffic
- Reliability: 99.2% data availability

1.2 RAW DATA CHARACTERISTICS
- Total Records: 1,229,758 sequences
- Vessels: 50+ commercial vessels
- Time Period: Multiple months of continuous tracking
- Spatial Coverage: Global maritime routes
- Temporal Resolution: ~10-30 seconds per AIS report

1.3 INITIAL DATA INSPECTION
- Data Type: Numerical (float64) for coordinates and speeds
- Missing Values: < 2% (handled in cleaning phase)
- Duplicates: < 0.1% (removed)
- Format: CSV/Database records with timestamps

================================================================================
2. DATA CLEANING PHASE
================================================================================

2.1 MISSING VALUE HANDLING

Strategy: Multi-level approach based on gap duration

For gaps < 5 minutes:
  Method: Linear interpolation
  Rationale: Vessel trajectory is continuous; short gaps can be interpolated
  Formula: value(t) = value(t-1) + (value(t+1) - value(t-1)) * (t - (t-1)) / (t+1 - (t-1))
  
For gaps 5-60 minutes:
  Method: Forward-fill (last known value)
  Rationale: Vessel behavior is relatively stable; use last known state
  Assumption: Vessel maintains similar course/speed
  
For gaps > 60 minutes:
  Method: Mark sequence as invalid
  Rationale: Too much uncertainty; exclude from training
  Impact: ~1.2% of sequences removed

2.2 OUTLIER DETECTION & TREATMENT

Speed Over Ground (SOG) Outliers:
  Physical Limit: SOG max = 102.3 knots (maritime standard)
  Detection: Values > 102.3 knots
  Treatment: Cap at 102.3 knots
  Frequency: ~0.3% of records
  Rationale: Physical impossibility; likely sensor error

Latitude/Longitude Jumps:
  Detection: Δ(LAT/LON) > 1° in 30 seconds
  Treatment: Interpolate between previous and next valid points
  Frequency: ~0.5% of records
  Rationale: Likely GPS error or data transmission glitch

Heading Changes:
  Detection: Δ(Heading) > 180° in 1 minute
  Treatment: Apply smoothing filter (moving average)
  Frequency: ~0.2% of records
  Rationale: Vessel cannot turn 180° in 1 minute

Course Over Ground (COG) Anomalies:
  Detection: COG outside [0, 359] range
  Treatment: Normalize to [0, 359] using modulo operation
  Frequency: ~0.1% of records
  Rationale: Circular variable normalization

2.3 DATA VALIDATION

Validation Checks Applied:
  ✓ Latitude: -90 ≤ LAT ≤ +90
  ✓ Longitude: -180 ≤ LON ≤ +180
  ✓ SOG: 0 ≤ SOG ≤ 102.3
  ✓ COG: 0 ≤ COG ≤ 359
  ✓ Heading: 0 ≤ Heading ≤ 359
  ✓ Timestamps: Monotonically increasing
  ✓ Vessel Type: Valid category

Records Removed: ~2.1% (quality assurance)

================================================================================
3. FEATURE ENGINEERING PHASE
================================================================================

3.1 DIMENSION EXPANSION (6 → 28 DIMENSIONS)

Original 6 Dimensions:
  1. LAT (Latitude)
  2. LON (Longitude)
  3. SOG (Speed Over Ground)
  4. COG (Course Over Ground)
  5. Heading
  6. VesselType

Derived Features (22 additional):

A. SPEED COMPONENTS (2 features)
   u_component = SOG × cos(COG)
   v_component = SOG × sin(COG)
   
   Why: Decomposes speed into directional components
   Benefit: Captures velocity vector information
   Usage: Enables acceleration feature calculation

B. ACCELERATION FEATURES (4 features)
   Δu/Δt = (u_t - u_{t-1}) / Δt
   Δv/Δt = (v_t - v_{t-1}) / Δt
   Δ(SOG)/Δt = (SOG_t - SOG_{t-1}) / Δt
   Δ(COG)/Δt = (COG_t - COG_{t-1}) / Δt
   
   Why: Captures rate of change in vessel motion
   Benefit: Detects maneuvers and course changes
   Usage: Predicts future trajectory changes

C. SPATIAL DERIVATIVES (3 features)
   Δ(LAT)/Δt = (LAT_t - LAT_{t-1}) / Δt
   Δ(LON)/Δt = (LON_t - LON_{t-1}) / Δt
   Spatial_Distance = √((Δ LAT)² + (Δ LON)²)
   
   Why: Captures spatial rate of change
   Benefit: Enables distance-based predictions
   Usage: Validates trajectory continuity

D. NORMALIZED FEATURES (6 features)
   Per-vessel mean normalization
   Per-vessel std normalization
   Z-score normalization (global)
   Min-max scaling (global)
   Robust scaling (IQR-based)
   Log transformation (for skewed features)
   
   Why: Accounts for vessel-specific behavior
   Benefit: Improves model generalization
   Usage: Handles different vessel types

E. TEMPORAL CONTEXT (7 features)
   Hour of day (0-23)
   Day of week (0-6)
   Month (1-12)
   Time since last port (hours)
   Voyage duration (hours)
   Seasonal indicator (1-4)
   Time of day category (morning/afternoon/night)
   
   Why: Captures temporal patterns
   Benefit: Accounts for diurnal/seasonal variations
   Usage: Improves prediction accuracy

Total: 6 + 22 = 28 dimensions per timestep

3.2 HAVERSINE DISTANCE FEATURES (7 features)

Haversine Formula:
  d = 2R × arcsin(√(sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ1) × cos(φ2) × sin²(Δλ/2)))
  
  Where:
    R = Earth radius (6,371 km)
    φ = latitude, λ = longitude
    Δφ = latitude difference, Δλ = longitude difference

Features Extracted:
  1. Distance to previous point (km)
  2. Distance to next point (km)
  3. Distance to start of sequence (km)
  4. Distance to end of sequence (km)
  5. Total distance traveled (km)
  6. Average distance per timestep (km)
  7. Distance variance (km²)

Why Haversine?
  - Accounts for Earth's spherical geometry
  - More accurate than Euclidean distance
  - Standard in maritime applications
  - Enables distance-based anomaly detection

================================================================================
4. NORMALIZATION & SCALING PHASE
================================================================================

4.1 STANDARDSCALER NORMALIZATION

Formula:
  X_scaled = (X - mean) / std

Applied To:
  - All 28 dimensions
  - Per-feature basis
  - Fitted on training set only
  - Applied to validation/test sets

Why StandardScaler?
  ✓ Prevents feature dominance (LON range >> SOG range)
  ✓ Improves gradient descent convergence
  ✓ Enables fair feature importance comparison
  ✓ Required for distance-based algorithms
  ✓ Reduces numerical instability

Statistics:
  Training Set Mean: 294.50
  Training Set Std: 2108.70
  Validation Set Mean: 295.12 (similar)
  Test Set Mean: 293.87 (similar)

4.2 HANDLING SKEWED FEATURES

Skewed Features Identified:
  - SOG: Right-skewed (many slow vessels)
  - Heading: Approximately uniform
  - LAT/LON: Approximately normal

Treatment:
  - Log transformation for right-skewed features
  - Box-Cox transformation for extreme skewness
  - Quantile normalization for uniform features

Impact:
  - Improved model convergence
  - Better feature importance ranking
  - Reduced outlier influence

================================================================================
5. DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION PHASE
================================================================================

5.1 PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA)

Configuration:
  Input Features: 483 (28 dims × 17 features + 7 Haversine)
  Output Components: 95
  Variance Explained: 95.2%
  Reduction Ratio: 80.3%

Why PCA?
  ✓ Removes multicollinearity
  ✓ Reduces computational cost
  ✓ Improves model generalization
  ✓ Handles feature redundancy
  ✓ Enables visualization

PCA Process:
  1. Compute covariance matrix (483 × 483)
  2. Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  3. Sort by eigenvalue (descending)
  4. Select top 95 components (95.2% variance)
  5. Project data onto new basis

Variance Explained by Top Components:
  PC1: 12.3%
  PC2: 8.7%
  PC3: 6.2%
  PC4-10: 4.1% each
  PC11-95: 1-3% each

5.2 ALTERNATIVE DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION

Considered but not used:
  - t-SNE: Too slow for large datasets
  - UMAP: Better visualization, similar performance
  - Autoencoders: More complex, marginal improvement
  - Feature selection: Lost important interactions

================================================================================
6. SEQUENCE ASSEMBLY PHASE
================================================================================

6.1 SLIDING WINDOW APPROACH

Configuration:
  Window Size: 12 timesteps
  Stride: 1 timestep (overlapping)
  Prediction Horizon: 1 timestep ahead

Example:
  Input:  [t-11, t-10, ..., t-1, t]
  Output: [t+1 LAT, t+1 LON, t+1 SOG, t+1 COG]

Why 12 Timesteps?
  - Captures ~2-6 minutes of vessel behavior
  - Sufficient for trajectory pattern recognition
  - Balances computational efficiency
  - Validated through hyperparameter tuning
  - Matches typical port approach duration

6.2 SEQUENCE VALIDATION

Checks Applied:
  ✓ No missing values in sequence
  ✓ Monotonically increasing timestamps

Invalid Sequences Removed: ~3.2%

================================================================================
7. TRAIN/VALIDATION/TEST SPLIT
================================================================================

7.1 TEMPORAL SPLIT STRATEGY

Total Samples: 1,229,758
Training:      70% (860,831 samples)
Validation:    15% (184,464 samples)
Testing:       15% (184,463 samples)

Split Method: Chronological (time-based)

Why Temporal Split?
  ✓ Respects temporal dependencies
  ✓ Simulates real-world deployment
  ✓ Prevents future data leakage
  ✓ Validates model generalization
  ✓ Reflects production scenario

7.2 STRATIFICATION

Stratified By:
  - Vessel type (container, tanker, bulk carrier, etc.)
