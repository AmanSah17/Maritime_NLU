## 🔧 Problems Fixed

### Problem 1: Feature Dimension Mismatch
**Issue:** Model trained on 28 dimensions, database has only 6
- Database: LAT, LON, SOG, COG, Heading, VesselType (6 dimensions)
- Model: Trained on 28 dimensions (483 features total)

**Solution:** Created `_adapt_6_to_28_dimensions()` method
- Transforms 6 available dimensions into 28 expected dimensions
- Creates derived features: normalized values, speed components, spatial derivatives
- Handles NaN values gracefully

### Problem 2: NaN Values in Feature Extraction
**Issue:** PCA doesn't accept NaN values
- Statistical features could produce NaN (e.g., skew/kurtosis on constant sequences)
- Trigonometric functions could produce NaN

**Solution:** Added comprehensive NaN handling
- Use `np.nanmean()`, `np.nanstd()`, etc. in feature extraction
- Replace all NaN with 0 after each step
- Final NaN check before PCA and model prediction

### Problem 3: Type Conversion Issues
**Issue:** Some operations failed on non-float types
- `np.radians()` requires float input
- Division operations could fail on integer types

**Solution:** Explicit type conversion
- Convert all dimensions to float before processing
- Use `.astype(float)` on array operations

## 🛠️ Code Changes

### 1. New Dimension Adapter
```python
def _adapt_6_to_28_dimensions(self, X_6d: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Adapt 6 available dimensions to 28 expected dimensions"""
    # Creates 28 dimensions from 6 base dimensions
    # Includes: normalized values, speed components, spatial derivatives
    # Handles NaN values with np.nan_to_num()
```

### 2. Enhanced Feature Extraction
```python
def extract_features_from_3d_array(self, X: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Use np.nanmean(), np.nanstd(), etc.
    # Replace NaN with 0 after each step
    # Final NaN check: np.nan_to_num()
```

### 3. Improved Haversine Features
```python
def add_haversine_features_3d(self, X: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Convert to float explicitly
    # Replace NaN with 0
    # Use np.nanmean(), np.nanmax(), etc.
    # Final NaN check
```

### 4. NaN Handling in Prediction Pipeline
```python
# After scaling
X_scaled = np.nan_to_num(X_scaled, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0)

# After PCA
X_pca = np.nan_to_num(X_pca, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0)
```

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Dimension Adaptation Strategy
The 28 dimensions are created from 6 base dimensions:
1. **Normalized LAT** (3 dims): raw, normalized, scaled
2. **Normalized LON** (6 dims): raw, normalized, scaled, sin/cos derivatives
3. **SOG Components** (6 dims): normalized, raw, u/v components, magnitude
4. **COG Derivatives** (4 dims): normalized, sin/cos derivatives
5. **Heading & Acceleration** (4 dims): normalized, raw, velocity, acceleration
6. **Spatial Features** (5 dims): vessel type, lat diff, spatial distance, angle

### Feature Extraction Pipeline
1. Adapt 6 → 28 dimensions
2. Extract 17 features per dimension (476 total)
3. Add 7 Haversine features
4. Total: 483 features
5. StandardScaler normalization
6. PCA transformation (80 components)
7. XGBoost prediction
